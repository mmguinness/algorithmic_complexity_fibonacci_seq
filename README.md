# Algorithmic Complexity

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to these questions:

* **Can you mention efficiency as one of the dimension of a good piece of code**
* **Can you join a conversation about algorithms and their complexity?**

## Overview of the course

* You'll work either individually or in teams of 2 and 3.
* You can use any programming language.
* You'll create a framework to time different algorithms and compare their efficiency
* You'll write your own algorithms, trying to be as efficient as possible
* There are workshops throughout to unblock parts of the problem and help you get further.


### Build your own algorithms

Now, let's look at efficiency for our own algorithms.

**It is strongly encouraged here to try to come up with your own take on these algorithms, and not simply research how to write them online.**

For now, we are not concerned with making them efficient.

For each algorithm you write, you should:
- [ ] Write a few tests (covering different cases)
- [ ] Implement them
- [ ] Run your timing framework
- [ ] Plot their curves

Once you have written a few, compare the shapes of different curves.
- [ ] How can you characterise the complexity of different algorithms?
- [ ] Which algorithms are more efficient?
